Browser testing
===============

- Proxy gets whatever it is asked for
- Script can download tests to execute
- Proxy can also load files requested on same URL but provide them itself
- Maybe configure browser to use proxy - can do on command line for Cr

Writing tests
-------------
- Use JS and jQuery throughout
- Use Mocha or other test runner
- In same window, test code can be synchronous unless the operation triggered is itself async
- Helper script can load jquery if required
- Proxy also receives results
- For CI, run proxy, run browser pointing to page under test
- Like old selenium, but test runs in browser page, not externally
- If proxy makes app and tests appear to come from the same origin, tests can open app in another window and manipulate it as they wish
- Proxied windows follow links to new pages, can still be used
- Test can get its own URL to find the app to test

Reporting results
-----------------
- Test script could communicate back to app via special path on proxy
- Report results, send back screenshots or HTML snapshots
- Send back console logs at end or as they happen by XHR
- Watch changes to elements (eg mocha div) and send them back as they happen
- Mocha reporter could send via Ajax

Auto Browser
------------
- Give it a test page to load in browser, which then takes over
- Or supply a script, which is inserted into a generated page and loaded in the browser
- Or a function, which is toString'ed and loaded in browser
- Can do any operation and report console or elements back to proxy
- Proxy sends output to a listener
- Command line browser remote control app runs any script you want in browser and outputs the result on stdout or to file
- Could use for screen scraping or whatever

Browser in charge
-----------------
- Browser runs the test, server "serves" it
- Server exposes commands to browser
- Could use for database init, recording results, whatever
- Could have auto remote control of server side JS object from browser
- Expose as REST API with URL specifying object path and method, args passed as JSON array
- Args would need to be JSON stringable
- Someone may have done this - quite like the Java/JS thing - DWT?
- Return promise on client side, server side function call may be sync or async

Controlling windows from third sites
------------------------------------
- Proxy inserts script at end of every page
- Post message to remote control other windows eg Google signin
- Remote control of foreign windows can only work if browser set to use proxy server
